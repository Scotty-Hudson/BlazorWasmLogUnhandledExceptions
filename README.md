This is an example of logging unhandle exceptions in Blazor wasm on the api server.
The api server also relays the log entry to a Seq sever.

This is currently targeting .Net 5 preview 8. This does work with .Net Core 3.1 Blazer 3.2, however.

If anyone has any suggestions on how to improve this please submit a pull request.
